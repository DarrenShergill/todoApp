# todoApp
Website using Flask (https://github.com/techwithtim/Flask-Web-App-Tutorial)
Wrote the website using flask where we can create a user and password. That
password is then hashed and stored along with the username. The site will 
remember the user as long as the app is running. People are not able to see the home page until they are signed in. After signing up, the user will automatically be signed in. The home page then allows the user to make notes that can only
be changed by that user.
